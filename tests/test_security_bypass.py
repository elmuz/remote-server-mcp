"""
Advanced Security Bypass Tests for Remote Server MCP

These tests identify security vulnerabilities that could bypass the current
whitelist-based security model. They cover:

1. Symlink attacks (local resolve vs remote execution mismatch)
2. Docker option injection
3. Unicode / encoding bypasses
4. Grep injection in log search
5. Null byte injection
6. Credential exposure via legitimate files
7. Environment variable attacks
8. Shell metacharacter edge cases
9. Path validation logic flaws

TDD Approach: These tests should FAIL initially, then pass after fixes.
